# Communications

Communication between representatives is fundamental to an efficient assembly. The modes of communication that the Student Assembly uses may differ based on the goal and the audience.

## Communicating with the General Assembly

The general assembly -- or more accurately, the voting and ex-officio members of the SA -- mainly communicates through Slack. You need an invitation to join our Slack Workspace, which contains channels for committees and different subgroups of the assembly. Reach out to the [Vice President of Internal Operations](student-assembly-leadership.md#vice-president-of-internal-operations) for assistance.

### Channels

Some private channels may not be listed here. All Slack channels begin with a hashtag \(\#\).
