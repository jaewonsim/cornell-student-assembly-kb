# Working with the Administration

## Principles

In many cases, talking to relevant members or groups within the Cornell Administration helps resolve issues without taking legislative action \(i.e. passing resolutions through the Student Assembly\). As such, reaching out to relevant admins is highly encouraged.

## Admin Members and Groups

Tip: The Division of Budget and Planning maintains [the most current versions of the University's organizational charts](https://dbp.cornell.edu/university-org-structure/). This can be helpful in figuring out which admin to reach out to.
