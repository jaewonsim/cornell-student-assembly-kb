# Attendance

## Student Assembly Attendance Policy

{% hint style="info" %}
Attendance is enforced following the current [Standing Rules](untitled.md), _Section 2. Ethical Standards and Attendance Policy_. Always refer to the latest version of the relevant governing documents for the most accurate information.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Attendance for Student Assembly committees are not governed under this attendance policy. This policy only applies to regularly, or specially scheduled meetings of the voting members of the Student Assembly -- including the regular 4:45 PM Thursday meetings. Refer to [Committee Attendance](../committees/committee-attendance.md) for information on the policy that applies to committees
{% endhint %}

### Why is Attendance Enforced?

While the reason we take attendance may be obvious, we highlight a few key reasons here:

* We keep track of whether we'll have quorum. By informing the VP of Internal Operations late, you may be wasting other representatives' time. Without quorum, we can't take legislative action.
* Simply, as a representative, you are expected to show up to meetings. This is a promise you made to your constituents when you ran for your position.
* Frankly, your absence reflects badly on the assembly as a whole. Having a good reputation is essential to being an effective deliberate assembly.

Always keep in mind that the purpose of the attendance policy is not to punish members. It is to ensure that the assembly operates at its full capacity and you, as an elected representative, have an obligation to contribute to the well-functioning of the SA.

### Who this Affects

Attendance is required at all regularly scheduled meetings for **all voting** and **ex-officio members** who serve in a liaison capacity. This policy **does not apply** to shared governance liaisons.

### When the Policy is in Effect

#### Regularly scheduled meetings

These are held Thursdays, from 4:45 PM until 6:30 PM., while undergraduate colleges are in session. All organizational and specially-scheduled meetings are also considered "regularly scheduled meetings" for attendance purposes when the Executive Committee provides SA members at least 24 hoursâ€™ prior notice of the meeting.

### Excusals

#### Excusal Criteria

When the [Vice President of Internal Operations](student-assembly-leadership.md#vice-president-of-internal-operations) is notified at least 24-hours in advance, the following are reasons for excused absences:

* Unavoidable academic conflicts including prelims, final presentations, and field trips **but not including** office hours, review sessions or professor visits that are in direct conflict with a required Student Assembly meeting

#### Exceptions to the 24-Hour Rule

In most cases, you will not be excused for an absence if you do not notify the VP of Internal Operations at least 24-hours in advance of a meeting. However, following are reasons for granting exceptions:

* Academic conflicts that cannot be reasonably predicted 24 hours before the meeting conflict can be excused by a _majority vote of the executive committee_
* Unavoidable conflicts as a result of job interviews and scholarship interviews that are in direct conflict with a required Student Assembly meeting can be excused at the _discretion of the VP of Internal Operations_
* Unavoidable conflicts as a result of religious obligations that are in direct conflict with a required Student Assembly meeting can be excused at the _discretion of the VP of Internal Operations_

#### Getting an Excusal

{% hint style="warning" %}
Frequent absences -- both excused and unexcused -- will result in the VP of Internal Operations requesting documentation from you. Eligible documentation could include email chains, or verification of exam schedule.
{% endhint %}

You may be able to get excused for your absence, late arrival, or early departure, depending on your reason.

Generally, you are required to notify the VP of Internal Operations at least **24 hours** in advance of the scheduled meeting you are going to be absent, arriving late for, or departing early from.

When notifying the VP of Internal Operations in writing, include the following information:

* For which meeting you will be absent, arriving late for, or departing early from
  * Include the date and time of the scheduled meeting, _in all cases_
  * Include when you will be arriving, _if you are arriving late_
  * Include when you will be leaving, _if you are departing early_
* Your reason for requesting excusal, which must meet the excused absences criteria
  * Include your grounds for excusal \(e.g. direct academic conflict due to a prelim\)
  * Include details about why this conflict is unavoidable if it is not obvious
  * Include why this conflict was unexpected, _if you have not notified the VP of Internal Operations at least 24 hours in advance_
