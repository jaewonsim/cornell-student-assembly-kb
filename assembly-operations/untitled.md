## Governing Documents

{% hint style="info" %}
The [most recent version of the governing documents](https://assembly.cornell.edu/shared-governance-cornell/student-assembly-governing-documents) listed below can be found on the Office of the Assemblies website, assuming the OA has updated these resources promptly after their amendment.
{% endhint %}

There are four main Student Assembly governing documents. The Charter has the highest order of precedence and overrides all other documents. The Robert's Rules has the lowest order.

### Charter

### Bylaws

### Standing Rules of Order

The Standing Rules most notably include:

* The number of absences to be recorded for each type of violation \(_Section 2: Ethical Standards and Attendance Policy_\)

### Robert's Rules of Order

Robert's Rules describe parliamentary procedures. These include motions and when and how the motions can be introduced. More details can be found online with a simple Google search on "roberts rules," on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert%27s_Rules_of_Order), or on websites like [this one](http://www.rulesonline.com).
