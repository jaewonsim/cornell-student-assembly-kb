## Making Access Requests

Student Assembly credential requests related to accounts or assets owned by the SA should be made by email to [credential-requests@cornellsa.com](mailto:credential-requests@cornellsa.com), **from your Cornell email address.** You should put -- in the body of the email -- the reason for making such request.

Possible requests include those for:

* Login details for social media accounts
