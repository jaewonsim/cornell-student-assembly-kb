# Liaisons and Delegations

Every year, the Student Assembly appoints liaisons to shared governance committees and administrative bodies of the University. The SA also appoints delegations to the other [shared governance assemblies](../about/shared-governance-glossary.md#shared-governance-and-support-groups).

This staffing process happens before the start of the Fall semester, but after the new SA representatives are elected through the Spring elections in the year before. The process is chaired and overseen by the [Vice President of Internal Operations](student-assembly-leadership.md#vice-president-of-internal-operations).
