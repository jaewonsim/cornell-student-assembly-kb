Style Guide: Members with edit access to this book should refrain from mentioning representatives by name. Instead, use their title and link the title to the relevant section of this page. For example, instead of "Vice President John Doe," simply say "[Vice President](student-assembly-leadership.md)" and link the title to this page as shown. This ensures that these parts of the knowledgebase stay accurate even with changes in SA membership.
