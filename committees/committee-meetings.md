## Recurring \(Regular\) Committee Meetings

### Scheduling

When setting up regular meeting schedules for your committee, keep in mind that **Student Assembly meetings take place from 4:45 PM to 6:30 PM \(or later, should the meeting be extended\)**. Do not schedule meetings during that time.

It is advised that the chair schedules meeting well before 4:45 PM or on other days of the week.

For guidance on meeting spaces, refer to the[ section on room reservations](../logistics/room-reservations.md).

Should there be scheduling changes, notify the [VP of Internal Operations](../assembly-operations/student-assembly-leadership.md#vice-president-of-internal-operations) by email.
