# Committee Membership and Attendance

## Committee Membership

### Staffing Members

All staffing proposals must be approved by the Executive Cabinet \(formerly the "Staffing Committee"\). To have your proposal approved, you can email the full name of the person you are wanting to staff, and their Net-ID to the Vice President of Internal Operations.

The VP will then send out a call-for-vote to members of the Executive Cabinet \(or have the proposal be voted on during an Executive Cabinet meeting\) and notify the chair of the results. An email-chain vote is more common. The chairs presenting the staffing proposal can also vote on their own proposals -- this is at their discretion.

Once approved and the results of the vote has beem called by the Vice President of Internal Operations, committee staffing can be accomplished through the [Office of the Assemblies website](https://assembly.cornell.edu).

### Removing Members

There could be a few reasons for calling for the removal of a member from a committee, bad attendance records being one of them. Refer to the [section below](committee-attendance.md#attendance) on the [Common Attendance Policy](committee-attendance.md#common-attendance-policy) for SA committees for more details should attendance be the reason for removal.  If a chair is seeking the removal of a member from their committee, they are encouraged to consult the Vice President of Internal Operations before engaging in the process.

The standard operating procedures for following up on bad attendance records is outlined in the [section below](committee-attendance.md#attendance). Please refer to it and follow the outlined procedures before taking action to remove a member for attendance-related causes.

Voting members of the Student Assembly are required to be serving on at least one committee at any given point during their term. Chairs must consult the Vice President of Internal Operations before removing voting SA members from committees.

The Office of the Assemblies website currently does not support the removal of committee members by chairs themselves. All requests should be sent to the Office at assembly@cornell.edu with the committee name, member name and Net-ID. Please CC the Vice President of Internal Operations on all such requests.

## Attendance

Effective September 21st, 2018, the chairs of all SA committees have voted to adopt the Common Attendance Policy. As such, members of all committees are expected to abide by the policy.

### Common Attendance Policy

To be written.

### Removing Members for Attendance Violations

When committee members reach three unexcused absences as noted by the chairs on the shared attendance sheet, chairs may remove these members. However, it should be noted that the purpose of the Common Attendance Policy is not punishment: it is to encourage members' attendance at meetings and ensure well-functioning SA committees. Hence, chairs should follow the procedures outlined here before removing members:

1. **At 1 or 1.5 unexcused absences**, chairs are encouraged to notify the members at risk of their unexcused absence counts.
2. **At 2 unexcused absences**, chairs must notify, in writing, the member that their standing in the committee is at risk.
3. **At 3 unexcused absences**, chairs must ask the member to clarify their reasons for repeated attendance violations, and to provide a plan going forward. That is, the member should agree to follow the attendance policy from that point onwards and acknowledge that member's attendance at required meetings is crucial to the success of a committee.
4. **Should the member be unresponsive, or if the issue is not resolved between the member and the chair**, please notify the Vice President of Internal Operations so that the member can be contacted by the VP directly. If such attempt by the VP is unsuccessful, the chair is encouraged to proceed to remove the member from the committee following the [procedures in the section above](committee-attendance.md#removing-members).
