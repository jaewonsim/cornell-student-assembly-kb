Working on the Student Assembly is not about passing resolutions -- it's about making student lives better. But resolutions can be a useful tool in reaching your end goal.  Before introducing a resolution to an SA committee, representatives are expected to carry out certain tasks, as outlined below. 

### Generate an idea and develop your initiative

* What student-and-campus-life issue do you want to address? Define the issue you're trying to address and its scope.
* Search for legislative history on the chosen issue.
  * Talk to senior members of the Student Assembly and members of the Executive Committee
  * Search the[ SA Resolutions database](https://assembly.cornell.edu/resolutions?field_assembly_name_target_id=7) on the Office of the Assemblies website.
  * Talk to the SA Executive Archivist.
* Do research on how peer institutions \(including other Ivy League colleges\) handle the issue.
* Solicit student feedback on the issue.
  * Utilize surveys and public forums to see what people think.
  * Reach out to relevant student organizations.

### Solicit feedback

* Talk to SA members who may have more knowledge on this issue, or even former members who might have worked on similar issues. The SA President may help with this process.
* Start a conversation with the relevant administrators. Refer to the [section on working with the administration](../assembly-operations/working-with-the-administration.md) on more information.
  * SA members sometimes discover that the administration can provide a resonable rationale for why things are done the way they are. Understanding such reason is important in the legislative process and might encourage you to view the issue from a different perspective which might, in turn, lead to solutions that you have not previously thought of.
  * Resolutions take a very long time to be debated, approved, and processed \(by the University President\). Recall that Resolutions are forwarded to the University President for Approval and refer to the [section on the handling of resolutions](resolutions-and-agenda-items.md) for more information. It may take a month and a half from when you initially bring a resolution to the floor to when you receive a response from the University President and depending on what time of the academic year it is, the semester may be close to ending before you hear back.

### Build a solution

Remember that solutions do not have to be in the form of a resolution. There have been many cases where SA members were able to reach an agreement with the administration to fix certain issues without passing resolutions.

Also keep in mind that resolutions can often be a tool for requesting information. For example, you can use them to request that the University President direct a specified member of the administration to produce certain statistics. Of course, this is assuming that you have already tried to gain access to the mentioned statistics through a direct conversation with the admin and were unsuccessful in doing so.

If you are sure that you would like to write a resolution, create an initial draft and involve other Student Assembly members or committee members in the process. Your resolution will have to be voted on by a relevant SA committee before being brought to the floor, so it's important that the committee chair be kept updated on what you're working on.

More information on the specifics about introducing and passign a resolution is available in [Resolutions and Agenda Items](resolutions-and-agenda-items.md).
