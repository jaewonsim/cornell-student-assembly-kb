# Resolutions and Agenda Items

## Resolutions

{% hint style="warning" %}
Access to the resolution template or other files mentioned or linked on this page may be limited. You may be required to login to Box with your Cornell credentials to gain access.

The [template for Student Assembly resolutions](https://cornell.box.com/s/tfiuslcwcrl8ogn72fpda3ped8afv77b) can be found on the SA Box folder.

### A Note on the Technical Stuff

The resolutions template is not the most user-friendly document. You will notice that the template may break when you try to copy-and-paste from other documents. Hence, if you're not working on the template directly in Word, make sure to copy and paste each clause, not the entire document. Many SA representatives choose to work on a shared Google Doc and paste the clauses into the template when the resolution is finalized.

### Getting Committee Approval

All resolutions have to be voted on \(and approved\) by a relevant SA committee. For example, resolutions related to student health and wellness would pass through the Health and Wellness committee. It's important that committee chairs are kept in the loop about prospective resolutions. Refer to the [page on the SA's legislative process](legislative-activities.md) for more information.

If you are unsure which committee is appropriate for your resolution, ask the Vice President of Internal Operations or the Executive Vice President for help. The Executive Committee will _only_ approve resolutions if it does not fit in any other SA committee.

To get your resolution voted on, email it to the chair of the relevant SA committee and have it placed on the agenda for the nearest meeting. Then, present your resolution at the committee meeting.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Make sure that your resolution is typo-free and grammatically correct before submitting them for committee approval! You've put in so much effort into writing one -- there's really no reason for them to be less than perfect.
{% endhint %}

### Placing the Resolution on the Weekly SA Agenda

Every week, you will receive an email from the Executive Vice President titled "Call for Agenda Items." For Thursday meetings, you are required to submit your resolution \(that has already been approved by a committee\) by midnight on the Tuesday of the week of the SA meeting. Any late additions will have to be approved by the SA through an amendment of the agenda.

All resolutions are required to be reviewed within **30 days** of its introduction.

## Announcements, Updates and Initiatives

On top of resolutions, agenda items also include **announcements or updates** you would like to make to the entire SA and students in the audience, and **initiatives,** submitted with a brief description or short PowerPoint presentation about the work being done.

These should also be sent to the Executive Vice President by midnight on the Tuesday of the week of the SA meeting.
