## Purpose

Members of the Student Assembly change over the years. Newly elected members are oftentimes confused about how the SA works, and old members leave, taking their legislative knowledge with them.

This book is intended to document some of the knowledge that SA members might have gained over their years on the assembly and to pass these onto new members.

## Vision

This book is not a replacement for governing documents. The most up-to-date rules that govern the SA are on the latest versions of the governing documents, while I try my best to update this book regularly.

The documents, though, are not easy to read -- and that is the gap this book intends to fill. This book will hopefully serve as a go-to reference for all new and returning SA members on the policies that govern us, and make it easier for representatives to understand such rules with minimal effort spent searching through numerous pages of antiquated documents.

## Proposing and Making Changes

This book is constantly evolving. Additions and amendments will be made. Any feedback by the extended Student Assembly community is truly appreciated.

Please email Jaewon Sim at js2689@cornell.edu for questions and proposals and I will get back to you in a timely manner.

## Style Guide

We want this book to be consistent. Hence, those with edit permissions should keep in mind the following.

### People and Names

The SA membership changes every year. Hence, editors should not mention people by name in this book. 

Instead, use their title and link the title to the relevant section of this page. For example, instead of "Vice President John Doe," simply say "[Vice President](../assembly-operations/student-assembly-leadership.md)" and link the title to a revelant page as shown. This ensures that these parts of the knowledgebase stay accurate even with changes in SA membership.

### Readability

This guide should not be a source document. That is, it should be a "readable" version of policy documents. Hence, editors should _not_  copy-and-paste any governing documents, but instead summarize or paraphrase them into more readable forms.

### Abbreviations

The first time a term is introduced, it is spelt out in its entirety. For example, the first time any page mentions the "Office of the Assemblies," the entire term "Office of the Assemblies" would be spelt out. Editors are then free to use the abbreviation "OA" in any future references. Any common abbreviations should be mentioned in the [Shared Governance Glossary](shared-governance-glossary.md) to aid the readers of this book.
