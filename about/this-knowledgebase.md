## Style Guide

We want this book to be consistent. Hence, those with edit permissions should keep in mind the following.

### Readability

This guide should not be a source document. That is, it should be a "readable" version of policy documents. Hence, editors should _not_  copy-and-paste any governing documents, but instead summarize or paraphrase them into more readable forms.

### Abbreviations

The first time a term is introduced, it is spelt out in its entirety. For example, the first time any page mentions the "Office of the Assemblies," the entire term "Office of the Assemblies" would be spelt out. Editors are then free to use the abbreviation "OA" in any future references. Any common abbreviations should be mentioned in the [Shared Governance Glossary](shared-governance-glossary.md) to aid the readers of this book.
