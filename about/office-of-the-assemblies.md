# Office of the Assemblies

## The Office

Located in 109 Day Hall, Office of the Assemblies provides administrative support to the Student Assembly \(and all the other shared governance groups\).

The OA is under [University Relations](http://universityrelations.cornell.edu) and reports to Joel Malina, the university's Vice President for University Relations.

Most commonly, the OA is able to help SA members with these tasks:

* Accessing historical materials related to the SA and the other assemblies
* Facilities for meetings \(e.g. room bookings, food orders\)
* Putting materials on the OA website \(not the SA website\)

Sending emails to the OA at assembly@cornell.edu notifies both Gina and Pam and this is the recommended way to reach out to the office.

## Members of the Office

Drop by 109 Day Hall to say hi to Gina and Pam! They're very friendly and they'll be happy to help you with any assemblies-related questions you may have!
