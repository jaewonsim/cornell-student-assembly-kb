# Room Reservations

## Making Reservations

Generally, room reservations can be made through the Office of the Assemblies. Reach out to the OA at **assembly@cornell.edu** a few days priors to when you need the room.

The OA can also handle recurring room reservation requests. This applies mostly to SA committee chairs booking rooms for their committee that holds meetings at regular intervals.

## Last Minute Reservations

SA members and chairs are strongly encouraged to use the OA-assisted process described above. In cases of last minute reservations, however, here are some suggestions. Most of the rooms here are open to the entire Cornell community and might not always be available for booking.

Collective Wisdom: This section would benefit from SA members and committee chairs adding new ones to the list. Please reach out to the VP of Internal Operations if you have suggestions.
