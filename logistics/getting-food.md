# Getting Food

## Principles

{% hint style="danger" %}
No spending before approval! All committee and Student Assembly expenditures must be approved by the Vice President of Finance. Do not place orders directly through the Office of the Assemblies if you have not received explicit approval. Also remember to CC the VPF in your request email to the OA.
{% endhint %}

### Committees

All SA members are expected to be good stewards of student money. Committee chairs are strongly discouraged from getting food for their meetings. Should your committee you be authorized for such expenditures, refer to [Committee Finances](../committees/committee-finances.md) for information on orders.

## Getting Food

Food orders can be made through the [Office of the Assemblies](../about/office-of-the-assemblies.md). The OA usually has a list of vendors they can place orders from. Make sure that the order is made at least 2 days in advance.

## Dietary Restrictions

### For Those Ordering Food

The [Vice President of Internal Operations](../assembly-operations/student-assembly-leadership.md#vice-president-of-internal-operations) maintains an up-to-date list of SA members' dietary restrictions. Email the VP to request access to the list. Common considerations to make are:

* Vegan food
* Vegetarian food
* Food not containing alcohol \(for those with religious dietary restrictions\)

### For All SA Members

If your dietary restrictions change for any reason, email the Vice President of Internal Operations so that our records can be updated to reflect the changes.
