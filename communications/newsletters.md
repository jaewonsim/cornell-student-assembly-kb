# Newsletters

The Student Assembly sends out a newsletter to every undergraduate student \(those currently registered\) each month.

To have content included in the newsletter, reach out to the [Vice President of External Affairs](../assembly-operations/student-assembly-leadership.md#vice-president-of-external-affairs).

## Using Sendy

The [Office of the Assemblies](../about/office-of-the-assemblies.md), and the Student Assembly, uses Sendy to send out newsletters. Members sending out newsletters themselves using the system should refer to the guide created by the OA. Other logistical questions should be directed to the OA.
