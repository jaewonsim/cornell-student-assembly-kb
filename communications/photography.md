## Storing Photos

### Guidelines

* Photos must be of SA members or related to SA affairs in some way. Photos that are generic in nature \(e.g. of everyday campus life\) should be stored elsewhere. This is to ensure that the database is kept at a managable size.
* **Graphics should not be uploaded to the folder**. This folder is only intended for works of photography.
* All photos should be in the highest possible resolution and not be watermarked in any way.
* Photos should be titled appropriate to describe its nature. This makes it easier to find photos.
* Photos may not be deleted without approval by the [President](../assembly-operations/student-assembly-leadership.md#president) once uploaded unless such upload was made by mistake and was remedied within 24 hours of the upload.

### Uploading via Email

Send photos to [SA\_Phot.rzqzup12gyaiz6ja@u.box.com](mailto:SA_Phot.rzqzup12gyaiz6ja@u.box.com) to have them uploaded to the shared Box folder.
