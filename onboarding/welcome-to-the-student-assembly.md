## Get Started



## Get Help

Help is always available on Slack at **\#onboarding**, a channel designed for new Student Assembly members. Ask any questions here and a senior member of the SA will get back to you soon. Commonly asked questions could also be added to this knowledgebase, to help other new members in the future.
